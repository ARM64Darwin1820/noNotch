# noNotch
Remove notches from iPhone X

# Issues
1. Immediately disappears and reappears when opening the Cover Sheet or apps
2. Doesn't work on full screen apps or full screen stuff in general (folders, app switcher...)
3. The status bar has corner radius instead of the rest of the screen. idk what class to hook and change its frames (can also be done by making status bar bigger and cutting out the bottom)

Fix those and get credited

# HOW TO INSTALL
1. Buy iPhone X
2. Wait for jailbreak
3. Modify Makefile so it compiles for iOS
4. Compile
5. Install
